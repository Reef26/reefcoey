					<p>Leckerbissen is a newsletter organised, written, edited, and published by students of the German Department of School of Modern Lanuages (and sometimes students of other schools) at Cardiff University. I made the website and still maintain it. The size of the team varies from issue to issue, I did majority of the design and editing of the Spring 2025 issue and have also contributed a few of my own articles throughout a few of the editions.</p>

					<p>ReefCraft is my Minecraft Java and Bedrock server, it's somewhat of a private server however it is technically open to everyone. The website, like all my website projects, it still a work in progress! Running this is very much a small hobby, I don't really have plans other running a professionally presented game server and getting to play some Minecraft with friends.</p>
